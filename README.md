A Weather App web, Easy for get now and future weather message. You can also choose your faviourse theme by yourself. We have much more Suggestion about your life, such as Sport,Travling,Clothes... 

I hope everyone should have a simple way to find out weather conditions. There were too many advertising and promotion about App in our Phone, so if you have a pure weather page like Native App, I'm sure you will be willing to use.

On the other hand, I will to design two language about this Web(English and Chinese), because of this personal work, sometimes you will find a English grammatucal mistakes or spelling mistakes. Please forget me.

git clone https://github.com/AleenL/WeatherApp.git
